I was asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My responsibility was to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

After gathering all the data for the project the data was then analyzed to include each of the following:

District Summary

A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)



School Summary

An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)




Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.


Math Scores by Grade**

A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade

A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


Scores by School Spending

A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)




Scores by School Size

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).



Scores by School Type

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

As final considerations:

Used the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.
Submitted a link to my Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
I also included a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.  The observations that are included in my attachments are below. 

Observations after analysis
Observation 1:  It appears that the Charter schools outperformed the District schools in all scoring aspects.

Observation 2:  There also appears to be a direct correlation to the high passing rate and school sizes.  The smaller the school size, the higher the passing rate.  This may be attributed to the fact that with smaller schools you have a lower student teacher to teacher ratio.
